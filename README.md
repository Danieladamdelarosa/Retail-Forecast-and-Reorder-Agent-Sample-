AI powered demand forecasting, inventory risk detection, supplier reliability scoring, and product quality insights.

This project replicates a real enterprise operations analytics workflow using OpenAI Agent Builder, Code Interpreter, and five operational datasets.
It simulates the core decision-making engine used by retail and consumer electronics companies like Tzumi Electronics.

This agent ingests sales, inventory, shipments, returns, and customer review data, then produces a full operational report including forecasting, risk assessment, and reorder planning.
